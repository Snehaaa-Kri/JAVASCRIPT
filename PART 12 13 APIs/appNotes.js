API - APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE

    > it is like a waiter (Interface = layer)
    > we send req to waiter -- go to kitchen and give us what we asked for. 


    > API is generally a way to talk to 2 softwares - don't deal with this.

    > APIs working with https(internet) is called WEB APIs.- this is what we study

    > These APIs returns some data in JSON format(instead of HTML, CSS AND JS -- like server does in REQUEST RESPONSE CYCLE).


    > EXAMPLES OF APIs: 
            1. twiter API - we can post, reply to our tags without opening our twitter account using twitter API.

            2. https://catfact.ninja/fact - sends random cat facts.
            3. https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity - suggests an activity to do when you're bored

            4. https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random - random images of dogs

            5. google maps api > directions api
            


    > We'll be first learining about how to use APIs and the wahile learning nodejs we'll be learning to create our own 
    APIs.
    
  
    




    
// ACCESSING APIs- in browser (incognito tab)    
    >1. by searching on browser(doesn't worked for me)
    >2. Using Hoppscotch -- for api    








//JSON - JavaScript Object Notation   (www.json.org)  
   
    >Interestingly - json is not a part of js. it is a format of API returning  --- jo ki js object ke format me hota h.

    > before JSON, we had XML - (Extensible Markup Language) 
        phle APIs XML format me data return krta tha.... but ab JSON format me hota h.
